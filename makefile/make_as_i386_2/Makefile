# This quick and dirty makefile for  
# Programming from ground up vol.1 book by
# Jonathan Bartlett written by hands

# I strongly adivise you against making 
# your own makefile by hand from scratch
# There are enormous amount of files 
# written by hand by authors who tought
# (and still thinks) that they are absolutely sure
# what they are doing! They are mistaken!

# Use CMake, or similar tools instead!
