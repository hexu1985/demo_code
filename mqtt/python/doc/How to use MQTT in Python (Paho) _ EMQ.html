Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/how-to-use-mqtt-in-python#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>MQTT is a kind of <strong>lightweight IoT messaging protocol</strong> based on the publish/subscribe model, which can provide real-time and reliable messaging service for IoT devices, only using very little code and bandwidth. It is suitable for devices with limited hardware resources and the network environment with limited bandwidth. Therefore, <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT protocol</a> is widely used in IoT, mobile internet, IoV, electricity power, and other industries.</p>
<p>This article mainly introduces how to use the <strong>paho-mqtt</strong> client and implement connection, subscribe, messaging, and other functions between the <a href="https://www.emqx.io/mqtt-client">MQTT client</a> and <a href="https://www.emqx.io/">MQTT broker</a>, in the Python project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/">Paho Python Client</a> provides a client class with support for both MQTT v3.1 and v3.1.1 on Python 2.7 or 3.x. It also provides some helper functions to make publishing one off messages to an MQTT server very straightforward.</p>

<p>This article will use <a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker">the free public MQTT broker</a> provided by EMQX. This service is based on <a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud">MQTT cloud service - EMQX Cloud</a> to create. The accessing information of the broker is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broker: <strong>broker.emqx.io</strong></li>

<li>Websocket Port: <strong>8083</strong></li>

<p>So far, we have finished that use the <strong>paho-mqtt</strong> client to connect to <a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker">the free public MQTT broker</a>, and implemented the connect, publish messages and subscribe to messages between the test client and MQTT broker.</p>
<p>Next, you can check out <a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt">The Easy-to-understand Guide to MQTT Protocol</a> series of articles provided by EMQ to learn about MQTT protocol features, explore more advanced applications of MQTT, and get started with MQTT application and service development.</p>
